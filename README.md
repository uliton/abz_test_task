## Description
* Buttons in header section and navigation bar are smooth scrolling to section.
* While users are loading, the preloader is displayed.
* Users section displays by 6 users. The newest user is always at the top of the list.
* Button "Show more" add next 6 users. When there are no more users, the button disappears.
* Inputs were taken from Material UI.
* Each input has its own error checks and displays them if there are.
* Until positions are loading from server, the preloader is displayed.
